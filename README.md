# Exercises of Programming

## What is Code Kata ?

A Code Kata is an exercise in programming which helps software developers improve their skills through practice and repetition.

The basic goal of Code Kata or Kata programming is to also to preserve and transmit working techniques and master them. By practicing in a repetitive manner, regardless of the industry, the learner develops the ability to execute those techniques in a natural, reflex-like manner. Here the idea is not only learn whatever concept and do it in an automatic way, here the idea is to learn the right concept, understand it and polish it. Be confident in what you are doing. Be a master in your field.

Code Kata is about learning, about learning by doing. After doing a Code Kata, developer should be able to execute and adapt learnt techniques under different circumstances, without thought or hesitation. This is the goal.

All great software developers that we know are as good as they are because they practice all the time. Code Kata is not just for Junior developers and recent graduates, it is for everyone, who wants to learn and practice new technique. Code Kata helps to know the theory, and to understand the mechanics, by actually applying it in practise.
